## Project
RADIO AMNION: SONIC TRANSMISSIONS OF CARE IN OCEANIC SPACE is a multi-year sound art project for the waters of Earth, commissioning and relaying new compositions by contemporary artists more than 2kms deep with/in the Pacific Ocean. During each full moon, far beyond human perception, the abyssal waters of Cascadia Basin resonate with the deep frequencies and voices of invited artists. All transmissions are relayed in the sea through a submerged neutrino telescope experimentâ€™s calibration system and available here online only during the three days of each full moon.

## Example
```python
import radioamnion

```
For more examples have a lock in the [example folder](./examples).
